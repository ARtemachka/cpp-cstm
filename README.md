# cpp-cstm

Custom implementation of C++ std library for learning purpose.

## Disclaimer

I am NOT a C++ expert. I am just a dude who wants to know more about C++ and its ecosystem so this project was created for purely educational purposes and is not intended to create something that would solve some problem or that should be considered as best practice.
